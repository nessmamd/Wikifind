Inspired by this video and these types of games: https://www.tiktok.com/@terrencepng/video/7064442878499736878?q=wikipedia%20speedruns&t=1760157591446

Goal: 
1. [IMPLEMENTED] Create a timed chrome extension with a leaderboard (html, js, + content scripts + service provider)  
2. [WORKING ON] Co-op against friends and/or computer (Server: Python/Flask Database: PostgreSQL, Communication: WebSockets)
3. [FUTURE] Locally trained model that creates varying levels  (Graph databse: Neo4j, ML Framework: ONNX Runtime, Graph Theory: Dijkstras, Node centraility measures, NLP: Word embeddings)
   - Easy: Short path (2-3 hops), high semantic similarity
   - Medium: Moderate path (4-6 hops), different categories
   - Hard: Long path (7-10 hops), obscure articles
   - Expert: Maximum separation, minimal common links
